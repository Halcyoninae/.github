[?] Halcyon? What? o_O
<
  Halcyon is a music player designed to be
  lightweight & intuitive for the average
  user, while being feature rich to an avid
  user.
  Although it is written in Java & bridged
  to native with C/C++, it features the 
  utmost optimization pedantics that can be
  either set by the user or automatically
  guessed by the program.
  
  Currently it supports playback of the
  following file types:
    1. MP3 (MP2 - MP1)
    2. OGG (Vorbis, OPUS, Theora)
    3. AIFF (Native)
    4. AU (Native)
   With partial supports for:
    1. AIFC (Native)
    2. FLAC (Partial Native - OGG)

[?] System Requirements >_<
<
  Note: MacOSX components have not been fully
        tested.
  
  In Short: If you can run Java and have 
            proper sound drivers and a
            display, this program will run
            "normally".
  
  Alert: The program itself uses around 35mB
  of memory on average, however the runtime
  will alloc more memory just in case, so 
  actual numbers may differ. It is your 
  jursidiction to decide what amount is best,
  however it is best to not to go under the 
  following memory numbers.

      include its own runtime (which the 
      above specifications primarily targets).
    - If you are using a vendor version that
      uses the client's runtime, runtime
      specs. will vary for your runtime
