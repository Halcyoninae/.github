======= Halcyoninae =======
This organization will be a 
collection of every single
project related to the 
Halcyon Music Player made
by Jack Meng.
----------------------------
[!] Naming
  Since Halcyoninae is a 
  a subfamily, and Halcyon
  is a genus under it; this 
  means that every project
  that contributes to the
  main program will be a 
  species from that genus.
  Each individual project
  will have their own 
  subsets; which of course,
  they do not have to 
  follow proper naming for.
